## Sample from log-normal distribution

First we are goint to sample 100 values from a log-normal distribtion with the mean and variance on log scale being 1 and 0.25, respectively. Then we create a histogram of the 100 values on original scale and on log scale.


```{r}
mysample <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
hist(mysample)
hist(log(mysample))
```


The mean of the sample is `r mean(mysample)` and the variance of the sample is `r var(mysample)` on the original scale.
